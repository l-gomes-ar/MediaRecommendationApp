# Overview

In this project, I developed a media recommendation app in Java to demonstrate my understanding of object-oriented programming and language syntax. 
The goal was to explore how Java handles complex data structures, like abstract classes and inheritance, through the design of a recommendation system for media content such as movies and TV series.

I aimed to deepen my knowledge of Javaâ€™s syntax, working with collections, handling JSON data, and utilizing libraries like Gson for parsing. 
The experience has provided insights into structuring and organizing Java code for better readability and maintainability, which is key to building efficient software.

# Development Environment

- Java (OpenJDK JDK 23.0.2) as the primary programming language
- Maven for managing project dependencies and building the project
- Gson (version 2.12.1) library for parsing JSON data into Java objects

# Future Work

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the application more interactive.
- Refactor code to support a more scalable recommendation system, possibly using a database.
